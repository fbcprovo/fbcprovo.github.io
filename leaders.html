            <h4>Keith Parker</h4>
            <h6><em>Pastor of ...</em></h6>
            <p>Keith Parker grew up on a farm outside of Hahira, Georgia. Keith was raised in church by his parents and even made a decision for Christ at the age of 11 but there was no change in his life in regards to the things of God. From the age of 11 to 24 Keith rebelled against God and lived a life of destructive sinful behaviors, shaking his fist at God and living as he pleased, but still calling himself a Christian. At the age of 24, by God’s grace and mercy alone, God caused Keith to turn from his rebellion and turn to Him through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ. This was truly a life changing event in the life of Keith and has given him the desire to share with, and show people what God can do in their lives. Since becoming a follower of Jesus, Keith has served and taught in various ministerial roles in the local church. He has earned a bachelors degree in missions, evangelism and church growth from Boyce College. Keith has also directed a biblically based residential addictions program in Louisville, Ky., pastored a church in Hahira, and presently serves as one of the pastors at FBC Provo. Keith, his wife and three children live in Provo, Utah.</p>
