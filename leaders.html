            <h4>Russ Robinson</h4>
            <h6><em>Pastor of Preaching &amp; Vision</em></h6>
            <p>Russ was raised in Middle Tennessee where he was saved by God’s grace at a young age. By his own profession he lived for many years as a “chief of hypocrites.” Late into his collegiate studies God used the doctrines of grace to wake him up to his true need of Christ for every part of his life, not just parts of it. During his studies and upon graduation from Union University in 2003, Russ served on the staff of two churches in Tennessee, started and stopped seminary studies in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked as a carpenter in Shelbyville, Tennessee. In 2009 he accepted the call from the First Baptist Church of Provo to serve as their pastor. Russ and his wife, Lesley, and their four children have enjoyed God at First Baptist Church since January 2010. His driving passion for First Baptist Church is to see every member captivated by the glory of God and dedicated to making Christ known in Utah County and all the earth. When he is not enjoying his family and church he can either be found reading a book, occasionally picking up where he left off with seminary studies, or enjoying all of Utah's outdoor activities.</p>
