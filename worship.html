            <h2>Our Worship</h2>
            <p>First Baptist Church Provo integrates many contemporary and ancient elements into how we structure our regular worship. To some our use of the creeds of the ancient church, and our more regular structure may seem unusual, but all that we do is informed by our understanding of scripture and the faithfulnes of saints who have come before us.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>We believe God is worthy of worship, and he calls us to worship him with other believers. At First Baptist Church of Provo, we believe that weekly worship is a central part of a Christian's life.</p>
            <h3>Areas of Worship</h3>
            <p><strong>Music.</strong> In our worship services we sing music spanning the whole history of the Church, from centuries-old hymns to current Christian music. We pick songs that are cross-centered, Bible-based, reverent, and glorifying to God. Our music is chosen to coincide with the themes of that week’s sermon.</p>
            <p><strong>Creeds.</strong> A creed is a simple statement of belief. At FBC Provo, we know that what we believe about God matters, and so we join saints throughout the centuries who have confessed these same biblical truths.</p>
            <p><strong>Offering.</strong> Part of biblical worship is giving offerings to God. We give, not out of fear or simple duty, but because we are grateful for what He has given to us. We collect our offerings in boxes to give you the chance to pray as you give.</p>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reading.</strong> Every service, we read one passage each from the Old and New Testaments. These passages are related to that morning’s sermon.</p>
            <p><strong>Preaching.</strong> Whenever we gather for worship, we hear a message explaining a passage of the Bible. Every part of the service is meant to help us understand and apply this message.</p>
            <p><strong>Time of Response.</strong> After the sermon, we take a few moments to allow the congregation to pray and reflect over what they’ve just heard.</p>
            <p><strong>Doxology.</strong> At FBC Provo, we end each service with a brief song praising God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We do this to declare to each other, our community, and the world, that we believe in the triune God.</p>
            <p><strong>Benediction.</strong> A benediction is a short blessing. In biblical times, worship services ended with a blessing pronounced over the congregation to strengthen them as they went out into the world. All of our benedictions come from the New Testament.</p>

            <h5 class="grey"><i class="icon-question-sign"></i> What is a Statement of Faith?</h5>
            <p><em><strong>Since our earliest days Baptists have been a confessional people.</strong> We have consistently and repeatedly distinguished our beliefs by putting them in writing. The history of Baptist confessional faith begins with Thomas Helwy's Declaration of Faith in 1611. The tradition continues through the following four centuries, even to the present day.</em></p>
            <p><em>These documents have been used by Baptists for numerous reasons, sometimes to defend themselves against charges of heresy. At other times they have formed the foundation for friendly cooperation, such as today's Baptist Faith &amp; Message. At its simplest a Statement, or Confession, of Faith is merely a document that states what a person or group believes to be true. For First Baptist Church Provo, our Statement of Faith is meant to clarify what we believe Scripture clearly teaches about certain doctrines.</em></p>
            <p><em>Our Statement of Faith fits within the broader Reformed tradition of Baptist confessions, drawing directly on the Abstract of Principles. Our Pastors/Elders have the responsibility to determine how to make use of our Statement of Faith and no member is required to subscribe to it. We do not use our Statement of Faith as a means to divide ourselves from other believers; rather, we use it as a tool to clearly state what it is that our church believes to be the truth and a guide for our teaching.</em></p>
