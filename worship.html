            <h2>Our Worship</h2>
            <p>First Baptist Church Provo integrates many contemporary and ancient elements into how we structure our regular worship. To some our use of the creeds of the ancient church, and our more regular structure may seem unusual, but all that we do is informed by our understanding of scripture and the faithfulness of saints who have come before us.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>We believe God is worthy of worship, and he calls us to worship him with other believers. At First Baptist Church of Provo, we believe that weekly worship is a central part of a Christian's life.</p>
            <h3>Areas of Worship</h3>
            <p><strong>Music.</strong> In our worship services we sing music spanning the whole history of the Church, from centuries-old hymns to current Christian music. We pick songs that are cross-centered, Bible-based, reverent, and glorifying to God. Our music is chosen to coincide with the themes of that week’s sermon.</p>
            <p><strong>Creeds.</strong> A creed is a simple statement of belief. At First Baptist Church of Provo, we know that what we believe about God matters, and so we join saints throughout the centuries who have confessed these same biblical truths.</p>
            <p><strong>Offering.</strong> Part of biblical worship is giving offerings to God. We give, not out of fear or simple duty, but because we are grateful for what He has given to us. We collect our offerings in boxes to give you the chance to pray as you give.</p>
            <p><strong>Scripture Reading.</strong> Every service, we read one passage each from the Old and New Testaments. These passages are related to that morning’s sermon.</p>
            <p><strong>Preaching.</strong> Whenever we gather for worship, we hear a message explaining a passage of the Bible. Every part of the service is meant to help us understand and apply this message.</p>
            <p><strong>Time of Response.</strong> After the sermon, we take a few moments to allow the congregation to pray and reflect over what they’ve just heard.</p>
            <p><strong>Doxology.</strong> At First Baptist Church of Provo, we end each service with a brief song praising God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We do this to declare to each other, our community, and the world, that we believe in the triune God.</p>
            <p><strong>Benediction.</strong> A benediction is a short blessing. In biblical times, worship services ended with a blessing pronounced over the congregation to strengthen them as they went out into the world. All of our benedictions come from the New Testament.</p>
