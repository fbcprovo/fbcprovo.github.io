            <p><strong>Missions.</strong> A creed is a simple statement of belief. At First Baptist Church of Provo, we know that what we believe about God matters, and so we join saints throughout the centuries who have confessed these same biblical truths.</p>
            <p><strong>Deacons.</strong> Part of biblical worship is giving offerings to God. We give, not out of fear or simple duty, but because we are grateful for what He has given to us. We collect our offerings in boxes to give you the chance to pray as you give.</p>
            <p><strong>Give by Mail: </strong>You may make checks payable to First Baptist Church of Provo.  They can be sent to 1144 Columbia Lane, Provo, UT 84604 and will be deposited with the next Sunday's offering.
